// Level Data
// This is where levels and phases are set up
// Separate levels with a #, and mark phases with a -
// Any line that doesn't start with # or - gets ignored
// for each phase, list the number of enemy groups of each size we want to spawn. 
// The actual order will be randomized during game play. 
// Group size isn't specified but rather it is determined by a number's position in the list.
// for example: 3,5,8 means a phase will have 3 groups of 1, 5 groups of 2 and 8 groups of 3.

# Level 1
- 8,8,1

# Level 2
- 5,8 , 10 , 21
