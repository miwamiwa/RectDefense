- check if there is a clear path way to the left or to the right (if the next hallwayWidth/2 + 1 squares are free). If there are two directions available make a choice.

- if yes, flag for turning left or right

- before moving, check for collisions:

- if turning, check if there is something on the square you'd turn towards

- if no, then turn to next square, and this becomes the new direction you follow

- if yes, then check if there is something on the square in front (wall or enemy)

- if no, then move forward (remain flagged for turning)

- if yes, wait for this tick.
